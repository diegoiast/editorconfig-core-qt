# EditorConfig Qt5 Core

EditorConfig Qt5 core bindings. Does not require any external dependencies.

## EditorConfig Project

EditorConfig makes it easy to maintain the correct coding style when switching
between different text editors and between different projects.  The
EditorConfig project maintains a file format and plugins for various text
editors which allow this file format to be read and used by those editors.  For
information on the file format and supported text editors, see the
[EditorConfig website](http://editorconfig.org).

## How to use EditorConfig Qt5 Core (QMake)

To include the library files it is recommend that you add it as a git submodule to your project.

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-qt.git editorconfig-core-qt
```

Then include the `EditorConfig.pri` file in your .pro project file.

```qmake
include(editorconfig-core-qt/EditorConfig.pri)
```

It can then be used within your Qt application.

```c++
#include <EditorConfig>

EditorConfigSettings settings = EditorConfig::getFileSettings("path/to/myfile.txt");
for(auto setting : settings.toStdMap()) {
    std::cout << qUtf8Printable(setting.first) << "=" << qUtf8Printable(setting.second) << std::endl;
}
```

## How to use EditorConfig Qt5 Core (CMake)

The easiest way, should be to use CPM (https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake). Then,
inside your application do:

``` CMake
# Or any other sha1 you want.
CPMAddPackage("gh:editorconfig/editorconfig-core-qt#master")
```

The follow instructions for QMake for code integration.

## Development

This has been developed with Qt 5.14, however previous versions *may* work. This has only been tested on Windows.

1. Open `src/editorconfig-app/editorconfig-app.pro` with Qt Creator
1. Build the release version (this will place the exe in a `build` directory in the root of this source code repository)
1. Using (cmd|powershell), navigate to the `build` directory
1. Execute `cmake ..`
1. Execute `ctest -C Release` (no clue why it needs the `-C Release`)
1. The majority of tests should pass
